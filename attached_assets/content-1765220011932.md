We collect the following types of information to provide personalized service recommendations:

- •**Personal Information:** During the evaluation process, you may provide details such as your gender, employment status, income range, language preferences, and city of residence. This information is provided voluntarily and helps us tailor service options to your needs. This data never leaves the app and is used to provide services that better suit the user.

However, if you choose to share a place via the app's sharing feature, that action is handled by your device's native sharing capabilities and is subject to the recipient's privacy practices.

### 4\. Data Security

Our role is to serve as an informational resource, connecting community members with publicly available services. All services listed are independently operated by their respective organizations. We verify information to the best of our ability, but service availability, eligibility requirements, and operating hours are ultimately determined by each individual provider.

Users should confirm details directly with service providers before visiting. Oasis Oakland is not responsible for the quality, availability, or outcomes of services provided by listed organizations.
